This is a 4x4x4 3D Tic-Tac-Toe player written in prolog using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

It have a sockets connection, so you can write your own player using other programming language and let them play against each other. You can even connect using PuTTY (Raw mode) and try to win from the computer (very difficult task, but not impossible!).

This project was developed for for the discipline of Artificial Intelligence of UFMG, Brazil.

Enjoy!
